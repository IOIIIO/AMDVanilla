# Vanilla AMD Hackintosh

## Why vanilla?

### It's clean

The AMD distro's are designed to be ran on various different hardware combinations, while a vanilla install is made for your specific hardware. This means that your install will only have what it needs and no extra useless junk.

### Tailor made for your hardware

A vanilla install doesn't have any unneeded kexts or modifications which could cause issues.

### More instructive

Making your own install teaches you a lot more about how hackintoshing works which in turn makes it easier for you to troubleshoot any potential issues.
